## Evaluating my Ideas
##### Time Calendar Checklist
- **Category**: Mental Health
- **Mobile**: My app comes with me at all times, so I know exactly what I should be doing at all times. In this app, there is push, real time, and a live calendar.
- **Story**: This app defines the Compound Effect. Small little good habits that you check off consistently makes you better mentally over time, and there is a sense of accomplishment as you view your progress bar. My peers would like this simple, but effetive app. My main goal is to make your life better by keeping it simple so you can actively build your goals over time.
- **Market**: The scalability of this app is pretty much anyone with an iPhone. Particulary, young motivated people have the potential to use my app, and people who understand that creating a better life is small, incremental steps over a long period of time.
- **Habit**: Daily. Some days we might not show up, but it should be a goal to come back and reach look at what u should/have to do. The average user consumes.
- **Scope**: I have about a week to submit something for my app. Based off my vision, this app can be very much done within that time. It will be difficult at first, because usually projects are already set up and I have to add details, but this time I'm on my own, but I am confident in my abilities because my problem solving skills have been getting better since I started college. Also a simple stripped down version of this app is still very interesting and effective. There is so much potential for this app, and I plan on expanding on it.


#### Streak Tracker 
- **Category**: Lifestyle
- **Mobile**: Within this app; there is a user-friendly interface, customizable features not available on websites such as FaceID, window pop ups.
- **Story**: This is a "dedicated tool" designed specifically for tracking streaks(you're proud of) or days since overcoming an addiction. It's a tool to **support** your journey, and encouraging you to shift your identity. Unaware addicts may not like this, but the people I wanna surround myself with would most definetly enjoy this idea.
- **Market**:The size of the market could be substantial considering the addiction issues worldwise. The scale could range from small to potentially large, it will initially begin small, but through word-of-mouth, partnerships, and groups, there are possibilities. Niche is most definetly health & wellness.
- **Habit**: My vision here is that I don't want these users, to constantly be on this app. Constantly checking how many days "free" you are defeats the whole point. The point is to dissoasccociate yourself with this identity, however, I plan on having navigation tabs, with the main homescreen being community interactions. The active day tracking is nice to check from time to time, just to be mindful of how far you've been progressing.
- **Scope**: I believe the coding for this app would be simpler than the former. The goals are defined.
